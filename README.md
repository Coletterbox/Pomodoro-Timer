# Pomodoro Timer
## Most Pomodoro timers aren't cute enough.

I just wanted a cuter Pomodoro timer; the others worked fine.

The Pomodoro Technique was created by Francesco Cirillo, and you can find more information here: https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique.

This was created by Raj Gupta (thank you!), and his code can be found here: https://codepen.io/rajdgreat007/pen/ZpZWbw.

His version was already beautifully symmetrical and such, so I didn't have to do much to make it more to my taste.

Most of the colour combinations are thanks to coolors.co.
